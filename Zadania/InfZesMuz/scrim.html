            Scott Arceneaux Jr., better known as Suicide Christ or Scrim, is an American punk rapper, songwriter, DJ, producer, and member of the rap duo Suicideboys.

His music career started in 2014 as a member of Suicideboys alongside his cousin, Ruby da Cherry whose real name is Aristos Norman Petrou.

As much fame as claimed through his music career, Scot Arceneaux Jr. has also attracted attention with his looks. He has piercings, tattoos on his face and other body parts, and metallic teeth.

His hairstyles also range from dreadlocks, as well as a mix of brunette and blonde hair over the years.

Still in his career, his lyrical content has been described as aggressive and evil. The description which has also been given on his band’s themes, images and even behaviours depict him in a negative way.

The star, however, sees the use of what society perceives as negativity or evil in his content as a metonym for the effects of money, drugs, and other items that can manipulate people.
