          <h4>About the boy$:</h4>
          <h5>
            $uicideboy$ dig light out of the deepest corners of darkness, addiction, hopelessness, and pain. The New Orleans-bred duo of cousins—<a href="">Scott Arcenaux, Jr. a.k.a. $crim</a> and <a href="">Aristos Petrou a.k.a. Ruby da Cherry</a>—translate a fight against demons (seen and unseen) into a clever, caustic, and corrosively catchy apocalyptic vision of hip-hop pierced with punk intensity and laced with Southern flows. After releasing dozens of projects and playing hundreds of sold-out shows since 2014, they’ve generated billions of streams and earned multiple RIAA certifications, including the platinum “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/30QR0ndUdiiMQMA9g1PGCm" target="_blank">…And To Those I Love, Thanks For Sticking Around</a>” and gold “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2XSrt1dcuOXPgl3B4bxmBz" target="_blank">Carrollton</a>,” “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3YeQsJs1FdLI3w0BqWwpmk" target="_blank">2nd Hand</a>,” “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1tm7c4V0kqLiN0XPVnoUcT" target="_blank">Runnin’ Thru The 7th With My Woadies</a>,” “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6tO5bxNnMuh1c3cziSpecA" target="_blank">Paris</a>,” and “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0kEZlJh4mK1QRfb3CT5LPk" target="_blank">Kill Yourself (Part III)</a>.” Beyond their critical-acclaim from Billboard, XXL, Alternative Press, Pigeons and Planes, Hypebeast, Revolver, and more, they built their label <a href="https://g59records.com/home" target="_blank">G*59 Records</a> into a bastion of independent talent and home to Night Lovell, Shakewell, Germ, Ramirez, and others. In 2022, the punk-rap duo landed in the Top 30 most-streamed artists across all genres and have climbed to the 92nd position of most-streamed artists of all-time with over 15 billion career streams. Their third official full-length LP <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3elJRIffdqvypuxoDND2Q3" target="_blank">Sing Me A Lullaby, My Sweet Temptation</a> marked their 3rd consecutive Top 10 album debut on the Billboard Top 200. The album led to a 50-city US arena and amphitheater tour followed by a European tour and a top-billed spot at Coachella music festival in 2023
